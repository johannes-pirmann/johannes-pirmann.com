## What is the Ledger Nano X?

As I explained in the article about [wallets](/post/wallets/) the Nano X is a cold wallet on which you can securely store your cryptocurrencies.

The Nano X is more convenient to use than the Nano S on the go as it has bluetooth capabilities. It has also a bigger capacity than the Nano S. The Nano X can handle up to 100 apps at the same time whereat the Ledger Nano S can only take up to 3 apps at the same time. And the display is twice as wide as the one on the Nano S.

You can get the [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x?r=f75e6a57dcc5)* for 119€ and the [Ledger Nano S](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s?r=f75e6a57dcc5)* for 59€.
