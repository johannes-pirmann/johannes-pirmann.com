        <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have one yet, you can get it here: Ledger Nano X*
What is the Ledger Nano X? As I explained in the article about wallets the Nano X is a cold wallet on which you can securely store your cryptocurrencies.
The Nano X is more convenient to use than the Nano S on the go as it has bluetooth capabilities. It has also a bigger capacity than the Nano S.</description>

        <description>What are wallets and why do I need a wallet? Wallets allow you to keep track of your cryptocurrency holdings. The most important features of those wallets are the public and the private key.
The public key is an identifier for your wallet. It works similar as an username on a social network. With the pubic key someone can send you money.
The private key on the other hand is like your pin for your bank account.</description>
