        <description>What is a brag document? A brag document is a list of stuff you did at or besides work. It is great for showing what you did to your manager when it comes to raises. Additionally, it helps you to reflect on what you worked on. I find it useful to see how far you have come and what you have accomplished.
How often should I update it? Update it regularly, like weekly or biweekly so you don&amp;rsquo;t forget anything.</description>
